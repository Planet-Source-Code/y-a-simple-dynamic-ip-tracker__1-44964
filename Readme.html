<html><body><table width=600><tr><td>Very simple dynamic ip address tracker.  We use this to quickly get the IP address of our cable modem.  We like the IP to change all the time for security reasons.  This application will let you know when your IP changes.  For an instant update simply move the cursor over the icon in the system tray.
<p>
To Set this application up on your server do the following.
<p>
1. simply upload the getip.php file to your webserver.  BE SURE IT SUPPORTS PHP!!!
<p>
2. Change the strURL default in the program to the getip.php file on your server.
<p>
register the OCX's and start the program.
<p>
to register the OCX's copy them into one of your system folders (c:\windows\system32)  Then at the Run command enter the following.  Run one line at a time.
